# Contributing to ProjectLearn

As this project is community-driven, feel free to open an issue (or even better, send a Pull Request) for expanding this list. Contributions are very much welcome.


## Project List Contribution

Note: Cloning the repository is not required. You can directly use the GitHub Online File Editor.

1. Ensure the project tutorial to be added doesn't already exist and it is of good quality (code quality, project scope & project relevance).
2. Update the [data.js](https://github.com/subhh33/Find-your-projects/blob/master/data.js) file. Project links must be pointing straight to the tutorials, no URL shorteners. 

## Feature Contribution

To get started, just clone the repository and run `npm install && npm run dev`:

    git clone https://github.com/subhh33/Find-your-projects.git
    npm install
    npm run dev
